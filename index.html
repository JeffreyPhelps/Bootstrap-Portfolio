<!--  Website Analysis:
      
      Bootstrap was pretty easy to work with and made the overall setup process a breeze. The automated 
      responsiveness is extra convenient, especially when combined with @media queries to make those 
      minor adjustments at each break point.

      I would like to see the image sizes on the portfolio page flow a little smoother, however, as the 
      site changes size. I need to find a way to incorporate auto sizing to the images, so they 
      automatically fit the box they're in, rather than the choppier way they change sizes now. I'd also 
      like to see the name title at the top of each page do the same thing. The last name currently drops 
      underneath the first name at a certian point, forcing the header to increase in size. 

      With fixes to these monor issues likely available, such as through JavaScript, if not simply within 
      CSS, simple websites like this are relatively easy to build. I have a feeling I'll be using 
      frameworks like this for many websites to come. -->

        <p id="mainText">
            You are looking at the future of web development. My name is 
            Jeffrey Phelps, student at the University of Denver's Web 
            Development Bootcamp 2017/2018. I am currently learning all the 
            latest in modern web design and development and hope to soon be 
            one of the leading web developers in the <em>real</em> world.
            <br><br>
            I am pictured here monitoring the matrix from the 
            homeofficekenezer, captured as I was preparing to have human-kind's 
            entire coding library uploaded to my brain. We were unfortunately 
            destracted by a group of sentinels and our electro-magnetic pulse, 
            intended to destroy them, also wreaked havoc on our systems, for 
            some reason. In addition to a giant, new debugging issue, this has 
            currently forced me to learn coding the "old fashioned way," as 
            they say, here at the University.
            <br><br>
            All is not lost, however, as DU is a fine institution in the matrix 
            and should do more than suffice in guiding me toward my goal of 
            becoming a well-rounded, full-stack web developer. The rest will 
            be up to me, but the sky's the limit.
            <br><br>
            This information, including examples given of what I've learned to 
            do, will be updated periodically and shown in the <a href="portfolio.html">Portfolio</a> 
            section of this site. Remember...All I'm offering is the truth.
